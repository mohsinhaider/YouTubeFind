Search effortlessly inside of YouTube Videos -- MHacks9

## Description
YouTubeFind is able to capture the transcript of a video and allows for anyone to search for a scene, dialogue, or text. In addition to generating the search capability, YouTubeFind generates analytics for content creators ("YouTubers") who are interested in learning more about their audience. Key metrics such as subscriber searching rates and habits and the frequency of YouTubeFind being used on a video is of the upmost importance to serious content creators.


## Motivation
Text based search in a document has been simplified with CTRL+F on modern web browsers. We were wondering: why don't videos on the web have the same feature? Whether it's to find a certain scene in a movie, or to find the start of a specific discussion in a historical documentary, we wanted to reduce the time it takes to find relevant parts of a video.

YouTubeFind is CTRL+F for videos. It's a web application that lets anyone search for a scene or dialogue within the YouTube video(s). On our website, http://youtubefind.tech, anyone can search within (inside) a YouTube video that includes closed captions.
